## Personality

Dardan Niveli is the main character of Vigilans Nexum and one of the leaders of the citizen militia of Bellum. He is a compassionate, generous young man who spent his childhood in the orphanage of Bellum, where he had the opportunity to meet people from diverse backgrounds. Dardan's tolerant and cheerful personality makes him well-liked by everyone he meets, but he hates how the orphans are labeled as "nobodies." As a result, he passionately works to improve his skills and prove to the world that they are somebody. With his quick learning ability, he can easily acquire new skills. 

Due to his past experiences, Dardan fears losing the people he loves and is determined to create a bright and peaceful future for the next generation. He is open-minded to different cultures and ways of thinking, thanks to his exposure to diverse people in the orphanage. As one of the leaders of the citizen militia, he demonstrates his helpfulness, independence, creativity, strategic thinking, and leadership qualities. As an idealist, Dardan's ambitious goals and dreams of a brighter future may seem unrealistic to some, but his determination to make a difference inspires those around him. Despite his impressive qualities, Dardan is his own harshest critic, which sometimes affects his self-confidence.

## Backstory

The Niveli family is an influential, long-established family in the Kingdom of Adolla that owns their own dukedom. Known for their generosity and peaceful demeanor, the family is responsible for the kingdom's foreign policy.

When the family patriarch falls ill with a rare disease, his son embarks on a journey to find a cure. Along the way, he meets new people and cultures and gains valuable experiences that prepare him to be an excellent successor to the dukedom. After successfully finding the cure, he returns home and is celebrated as a hero.

However, the son's siblings exchange the cure for a poison, worsening their father's condition. Their goal is to take away their brother's birthright as the successor to the dukedom. The family patriarch believes that his son intentionally poisoned him to gain the throne early, so he disinherits and banishes him from the dukedom. The eldest sister becomes the new successor.

A year later, the son and his wife settle in a village and have their first child. Tragically, the child dies during birth. In reality, the child was kidnapped by the son's sisters. Despite the tragedy, the couple decides to try again and eventually have a second child named Dardan, who becomes the protagonist of the story.

The sisters hear the news about their brother and hire assassins to eliminate the small, happy family. Although the first attempt is thwarted, the family can no longer stay in their village and must flee from place to place to evade the assassins. In Bellum, they stumble upon an orphanage and consider leaving Dardan there to protect him from harm. Ultimately, they leave him at the orphanage and flee the country with heavy hearts.
