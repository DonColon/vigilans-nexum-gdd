## Backstory

The Niveli family is an influential, long-established family in the Kingdom of Adolla that owns their own dukedom. Known for their generosity and peaceful demeanor, the family is responsible for the kingdom's foreign policy.

When the family patriarch falls ill with a rare disease, his son embarks on a journey to find a cure. Along the way, he meets new people and cultures and gains valuable experiences that prepare him to be an excellent successor to the dukedom. After successfully finding the cure, he returns home and is celebrated as a hero.

However, the son's siblings exchange the cure for a poison, worsening their father's condition. Their goal is to take away their brother's birthright as the successor to the dukedom. The family patriarch believes that his son intentionally poisoned him to gain the throne early, so he disinherits and banishes him from the dukedom. The eldest sister becomes the new successor.

A year later, the son and his wife settle in a village and have their first child. Tragically, the child dies during birth. In reality, the child was kidnapped by the son's sisters. Despite the tragedy, the couple decides to try again and eventually have a second child named Dardan, who becomes the protagonist of the story.

The sisters hear the news about their brother and hire assassins to eliminate the small, happy family. Although the first attempt is thwarted, the family can no longer stay in their village and must flee from place to place to evade the assassins. In Bellum, they stumble upon an orphanage and consider leaving Dardan there to protect him from harm. Ultimately, they leave him at the orphanage and flee the country with heavy hearts.
